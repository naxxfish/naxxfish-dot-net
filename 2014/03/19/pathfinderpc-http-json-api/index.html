Pathfinder has a way of doing this — using Protocol Translators. Basically, it\u0026rsquo;s a TCP listener (or client, or Serial Port) which accepts and sends commands to a remote device. The protocol is very well documented in the manual, and is very flexible in what it lets you do.\nBut, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a pain to connect to from, lets say, PHP — which isn\u0026rsquo;t really well suited to doing socket operations. Also, you\u0026rsquo;d want to cache the results somehow, lest poor Pathfinder get inundated by people looking at the webcam!\nSo I decided to make a little thingy that sits in between Pathfinder and the potentially unruly web apps on the other end.\nThus, PFInterfaceWeb. It exposes various data sources over HTTP — like a list of all source, destinations and current routes. Also — and particularly usefully — memory slots! This lets us query our Stack Event logic and work out who\u0026rsquo;s on air, what mics are live…. etc etc.\nOh, also, it optionally can send messages to a STOMP compatible Message Queue server whenever a memory slot, or route, changes, or custom Protocol Translator commands are sent.\nAt some point, I\u0026rsquo;ll make it monitor GPIO, and also Silence Detect events.\nHopefully, this will prove handy!\n"}</script></head><body class=blue><div class="container center headings--one-size"><header class=header><div class=header__inner><div class=header__logo><a href=/><div class=logo>naxxfish</div></a></div><div class=menu-trigger>menu</div></div><nav class=menu><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--desktop"><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=https://www.github.com/naxxfish/>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://naxxfish.photography>My Photography</a></li><li><a href=/wish-list>Wish List</a></li></ul><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--mobile"><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=https://www.github.com/naxxfish/>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://naxxfish.photography>My Photography</a></li><li><a href=/wish-list>Wish List</a></li></ul></nav></header><div class=content><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/2014/03/19/pathfinderpc-http-json-api/>PathfinderPC HTTP JSON API</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2014-03-19</span>
