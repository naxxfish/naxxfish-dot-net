<p>I was at one time, a BT customer.  They had the best deal for FTTC broadband in my area, so it made sense to go with them.  One of the things they offered at the time was a Yahoo account – which for some inexplicable reason you were forced to link to any previous account with the same email address.</p>

<p>After I moved to another place where different broadband was available – and cancelled my BT account – that&rsquo;s when the trouble started.  Suddenly, I could no longer get into my Yahoo account.  Every time I went to reset the password, I&rsquo;d get redirected to a password reset page</p>
<p>And, if I entered my once BT email address (which I never used!), I got an error telling me to contact the BT helpdesk.</p>
<p>Helpful!  The link to “helpdesk” goes to the <a href=https://bt.custhelp.com/app/contact/c/3274>BT Contact Us</a> page, which is utterly useless, as it assumes I&rsquo;m a BT customer (which I&rsquo;m not) and want to talk to them about one of their products or my bill.</p>

I thought that the Web got over this non-sense years ago; If you must make it a binary choice, at <em>least</em> make it optional.  Pretty simple stuff – nobody is asking for you to <a href=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/15/the-complete-glossary-of-facebook-s-51-gender-options.html>list all of the different genders that Facebook uses</a> for example, but just don&rsquo;t force users to conform to one of two genders when there is literally no reasonable reason why they should.</p>
