I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer.
I believe in
Ethical, appropriate and sensible application of big data and ML. Taking a pragmatic approach to automated testing (test coverage isn&amp;rsquo;t everything). Designing systems that minimise carbon emissions and energy usage during their operational life. Being accountable for the products you build. Empowering users to achieve their goals, rather than mollycoddling them and making decisions for them. Harnessing creative chaos where it&amp;rsquo;s useful, but limiting it when it&amp;rsquo;s not.</description></item><item><title>A Crunchless Hackathon</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2022-08-09-crunchless-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2022-08-09-crunchless-hackathon/</guid><description>Hackathons or Hackdays or &amp;ldquo;Innovation Days&amp;rdquo; or whatever you want to call them have been a mainstay in tech for a while now. Sometimes, they&amp;rsquo;re seen as a simple &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; for an organisation that&amp;rsquo;s lacking innovation (spoiler: that&amp;rsquo;s not how they work). But, just so we&amp;rsquo;re all on the same page:
A Hackathon is a time limited sprint where (primarily) software is created
I&amp;rsquo;ve been purposely vauge here - but I think this definition encompasses most things that someone would call a &amp;ldquo;Hackathon&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>This is fine üî• (no, it's not)</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2022-07-20-on-fire/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2022-07-20-on-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a staunch advocate of &lt;a href="https://naxxfish.net/affordable-sustainability-2021/">sustainability&lt;/a>. Being an engineer, I make things - and one of my life goals is for everything I build to use as little energy (and therefore carbon emissions) as possible. Because, in my view, I can contribute to limiting climate change, even in a small way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, the UK has seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/20/heatwave-led-to-london-firefighters-busiest-day-since-second-world-war">hottest temperatures in recorded history&lt;/a>. All of our infrastructure experienced failures - roads, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/britains-rail-services-severely-disrupted-as-heatwave-damage-is-repaired">railways&lt;/a>, electricity grids. There were droughts, and the firefighters were busier than they have ever been since World War 2. Our homes are &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62179678">ill equipped for these kinds of temperatures&lt;/a> and this will cost lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most news outlets were quite clear: this heatwave is a direct result of climate change. The Sun and the Daily Express gave it a different spin - we&amp;rsquo;re all getting a free holiday right on our doorstep! Hooray! üôÑ&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is everyone going to build the Metaverse?</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2021-11-29-everyones-building-a-metaverse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2021-11-29-everyones-building-a-metaverse/</guid><description>Ever since Meta (nee Facebook) announced their intention of building &amp;ldquo;the Metaverse&amp;rdquo; in their Facebook Connect conference keynote in 2021, changing their name in the process - the world has been simultaneously enthrealled, amused and terrified by the idea of spending more of their time in a virtual world rather than the real one.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because they remember the dystopian setting of Ready Player One, where people live in towering stacks of containers because their cities have become uninhabitable due to overcrowding and energy shortages are commonplace - and the only way to escape is through the OASIS &amp;ldquo;metaverse&amp;rdquo; - leading them to neglect to fix the problems with physical society in preference to enjoying a virtual one instead.</description></item><item><title>Crowdfunding Witch-hunt: Debunking Debunks of Aurora Nutrio</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2021-04-18-crowdfunding-witchhunt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/posts/2021-04-18-crowdfunding-witchhunt/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many moons ago, I was a host on a podcast called The Gadget Crowd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="TGC-coverart.jpg" alt="I&amp;amp;rsquo;m the guy on the far left, raising my eyebrow">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My role was to do the deep dives into the technical feasibility of the projects that we talked about - usually tempering the hyperbolic claims of the campaigns into something more realistic. I also featured a number of exceptionally bizarre campaigns claiming everything from a perpetual motion machine powered by demonic forces (legitimately what the project claimed), to a device that was designed to release your inner &lt;em>chi&lt;/em> by regularly beeping (who&amp;rsquo;s campaign text read much like the incoherent ramblings of someone with severe psychosis).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years, many crowdfunded tech projects have come and gone, and the public has now experienced a range of outcomes from great success (for example the &lt;a href="https://www.riut.co.uk/">RiutBag&lt;/a>, which delivered exactly as intended and is a ongoing business delivering new, useful, products regularly), to great failures (like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down">Juicero&lt;/a> - which was a legitimate, but dumb, idea that just failed), to outright scams (like &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1041610927/znaps-the-9-magnetic-adapter-for-your-mobile-devic/description">ZNAPS&lt;/a> - where backers have now resorted to magic incantations trying to get their money back). The general public has seen it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast forward a few (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em> five) years, and there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/">/r/shittykickstarters&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let me say, most of the posts on this subreddit are legitimately bad campaigns - which are either unfeasible, physically impossible or in some other way questionable (e.g. rebrands of products available from contract manufacturers). But sometimes, those redditors are a bit too ready to take up their pitchfork&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take this one, &lt;a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/aurora-nutrio-the-easiest-way-to-track-food/x/19988273#/">Aurora Nutrio&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sustainability: An affordable future?</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/affordable-sustainability-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/affordable-sustainability-2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>I found myself looking for a better option for tying my hair up in a ponytail. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for over a decade, and isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to change soon. But the ties I&amp;rsquo;ve been buying keep breaking - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what I do, they just get looser and looser until they don&amp;rsquo;t hold my hair properly, and then they snap. So I started looking for reusable, robust products designed to fulfil this purpose, and I came across &lt;a href="https://www.tabithaeve.co.uk/products/nobbles-plastic-free-hair-ties">these hair ties from Tabitha Eve&lt;/a>. They come in a pack of 5, and their RRP is &lt;strong>¬£10&lt;/strong> (although they&amp;rsquo;re on sale for ¬£6 currently). The ones I get normally are about ¬£3 for a pack of 18 from Superdrug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This prompted a train of thought - as much as I support sustainable and ethical consumerism - is the hope that one day all consumers will be ethical consumers completely detatched from reality?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WhatsApp Migration</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/whatsapp-keychange/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/whatsapp-keychange/</guid><description>Hello! You might have found this because I&amp;rsquo;ve sent you a message saying that I&amp;rsquo;m moving phone üì±
This is in fact true! On the 5th July, 2020, I have got a new phone.

And whilst for the most part this process has been polished to a high sheen by Apple, desperate to make the transition frictionless, there are a few notable gaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of those, is WhatsApp message history - which is not possible to port between OSes. This missing feature has unintentionally spawned a plethora of questionable third party software solutions, and some even more questionable marketing techniques.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore why the problem exists, why it&amp;rsquo;s not easily solved, and the &amp;ldquo;opportunity&amp;rdquo; that these software providers are exploiting, and perhaps the people too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remote ID and Drones</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/2020/03/08/remote-id-and-drones/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 11:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/2020/03/08/remote-id-and-drones/</guid><description>&lt;p>Drone safety is a topic which has had particular interest after &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47919680">recent incidents&lt;/a>. Whilst there have yet to be any cases of a drone actually colliding with an aircraft, there&amp;rsquo;s a definitely feeling there is a percieved risk of this occurring - which is sufficient that seeing a drone anywhere near close to an airport will immediately cause mass chaos as the entire airport is grounded until it has been removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With tech giants like Amazon developing automated drone-delivery systems, the number of drones in the skies is likely to increase - and obviously law-makers are being pressured to make sure that this is a safe future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Photography Workflow</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/2019/12/08/my-photography-workflow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2019 00:33:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/2019/12/08/my-photography-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://naxxfish.photography">I make photographs&lt;/a> in my spare time.

&lt;p>As a long time user of &lt;a href="http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/">Realtimetrains.co.uk&lt;/a> (which is where you should go for all your real time train tracking needs in the UK), and someone with an appreciation of Open Rail Data (having &lt;a href="https://github.com/naxxfish/nrod-funnel">used it myself&lt;/a>), I jumped at the chance of helping their development.¬† They&amp;rsquo;ve put out an appeal to &lt;a href="http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/tracks/">record GPS tracks&lt;/a> of train services that you travel on with the link to the service on the application.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A lot of the work behind the scenes performed by a small team involves maintaining data relating to train positioning and comparing this with the signalling system outputs we use. This is an entirely manual task involving one of us going out with a radio controlled watch and monitoring the passage of trains through stations and junctions. An area of recent interest for us has been attempting to compute this automatically using other known bits of information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to validate this effort, we either have to do the manual task with a watch or collect a large dataset of GPS traces to compare against our dataset. The more data we have will allow us to improve the end product.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which is awesome.¬† I wanted to contribute. I found a suitable app for Android called &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger">GPSlogger&lt;/a>¬†which seemed to fit the bill.¬† It has quite a few settings, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick guide on what I&amp;rsquo;ve used to successfully generate a working track for a service.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I don‚Äôt want a Yahoo ID any more</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/2015/10/30/why-i-dont-want-a-yahoo-id-any-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 13:11:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/2015/10/30/why-i-dont-want-a-yahoo-id-any-more/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was at one time, a BT customer. ¬†They had the best deal for FTTC broadband in my area, so it made sense to go with them. ¬†One of the things they offered at the time was a Yahoo account ‚Äì which for some inexplicable reason you were forced to link to any previous account with the same email address.&lt;/p>

There were some not insignficant challenges. Our normal network access at Keynes was effectively cut off due to some changes to configuration. This was quite troublesome, as we had always previously relied on this access to get our signals back to our HQ. The outlook seemed bleak. What we ended up doing instead, though, actually seemed to work out rather better.</description></item><item><title>PathfinderPC HTTP JSON API</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/2014/03/19/pathfinderpc-http-json-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2014 00:30:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/2014/03/19/pathfinderpc-http-json-api/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping with the installation of a brand new Axia Livewire network at CSR FM. We&amp;rsquo;ve been using PathfinderPC to do all of the routing control.
It&amp;rsquo;s all pretty clever stuff ‚Äî but we wanted to be able to extract information from Pathfinder so that we could do handy things like find out which studio is on air, and use that information to show the right webcam on the website, or use it to add further information to our Now Playing data.</description></item><item><title>Betheremin 0.1</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/2014/02/02/betheremin-0-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2014 18:54:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/2014/02/02/betheremin-0-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>My partner, Beth, asked me if I could make her a Theremin. ¬†So I have. ¬†It&amp;rsquo;s called the Betheremin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin&lt;/a> is a musical instrument, which changes pitch and/or volume as you bring your hand close to it&amp;rsquo;s antenna(e). ¬†The way this works is by your hand influencing the capacitance of a resonator circuit, changing the frequency at which it oscillates. ¬†This difference in frequency creates a ‚Äúbeat‚Äù frequency against a reference oscillator, which can then be used to create an audible frequency or control a Voltage Controlled Amplifier.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>about</title><link>https://naxxfish.net/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2014 21:11:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naxxfish.net/about/</guid><description>üëãüèª Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Chris.
