**Hi, I'm Chris.&nbsp;**

I'm mostly from London, UK &ndash; which is where I presently live and work for an international broadcaster (views expressed here are entirely my own&#8230;) as a Principal Systems Engineer in the area of radio studio technology.

I'm an aspiring (but not very good) [photographer][1]&nbsp;.

I like to [code][2] sometimes.

I hold a UK Amateur Radio Operator License, callsign M7NXF.

You'll often find me at [An Evening of Unnecessary Detail][3].&nbsp; Because I don't get enough of unnecessary detail during the day, apparently.

I once helped (at least, mostly helped) [Matt Parker][4] [build a computer out of Dominos][5] (you can see me at [3:14][6])

I've been a contributor to [Helen Zaltzman's][7] podcast [The Allusionist][8], and was briefly in [Episode 75 of No Such Thing as a Fish][9].

I was one of the founders of the [University of Kent Tinkering Society (tinkersoc)][10]

My site icon is a [modified emoji 1f40b (üêã)</span>][11] 

I enjoy a good list (evidently)
