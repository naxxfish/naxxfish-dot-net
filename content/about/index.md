**üëãüèª Hi, I'm Chris.**

Nice to meet you! I'm from London, UK &ndash; which is where I presently live and work for an international broadcaster (views expressed here are entirely my own, etc.) as a Product Manager in the area of radio metadata workflows.

I'm an aspiring (but not especially good) [photographer][1].

I often [code][2].

I hold a UK Amateur Radio Operator License, callsign M7NXF.

I'm the owner of both a beard, and a ponytail.

You'll often find me at [An Evening of Unnecessary Detail][3]. Because I don't get enough of unnecessary detail during the day, apparently.

I once helped (at least, mostly helped) [Matt Parker][4] [build a computer out of Dominos][5] (you can see me at [3:14][6])

I've been a contributor to [Helen Zaltzman's][7] podcast [The Allusionist][8], and was briefly in [Episode 75 of No Such Thing as a Fish][9].

I was one of the founders of the [University of Kent Tinkering Society (tinkersoc)][10]

I'm an advocate of digital rights, privacy and free speech online, and am a member of the [Open Rights Group][12]

I'm a member of the [Audio Engineering Society](http://www.aes.org/).

My site icon is a [modified emoji 1f40b (üêã)</span>][11]

Whilst [I am on twitter](https://twitter.com/naxxfish), I prefer [decentralised social media](https://mastodon.technology/@naxxfish)

I enjoy a good list (evidently)
