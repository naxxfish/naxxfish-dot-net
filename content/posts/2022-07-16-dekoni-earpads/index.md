A while ago I wrote a post about [my headphones](https://naxxfish.net/2018/06/26/my-headphones/).  Sadly, those cans are no more - one of the drivers died one day and they were beyond economical repair. And, given this was approximately when we started working from home full time in March 2020 - I ended up side-grading to the open back version of those same headphones ([beyerdynamic DT990 Pro](https://europe.beyerdynamic.com/dt-990-pro.html)).

As is the way with headphones, over time, the ear-pads become worn and gross and loose their padding. It was time for a replacement. I've never been a massive fan of the stock beyerdynamic earpads - they get dirty fast and not all that comfortable. So, I thought I'd try the Dekoni Audio third party replacement pads...

Previously, I've used [Brainwavz](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R3J7BR1413WG4G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B072PPPWBF) ear pads as pleasant PU leather replacement. They were pretty good (as I noted in the review) - but I wondered whether there were better options out there in 2022. 

So I popped to my [local specialist audio retailer](https://www.audiosanctuary.co.uk/) to pick up a pair of [Dekoni Audio Platinum Series Replacement Ear Pads for DT770/DT880/DT990](https://dekoniaudio.com/product/platinum-ear-pads-for-beyerdynamic-headphones/). In the shop I was able to feel the difference between the leather and suede versions. Suede felt a bit too warm for me - so I left with the leather models. 

You might wonder, surely they're just foam that goes on your head, what's the big deal about? Well, you're partly right - but since they form part of the transducer-to-ear system, they do have a real impact on the sound you hear. There's a thorough blog post from the manufacturer about [measurements using their pads](https://dekoniaudio.com/beyerdynamic-dt1990-measurements/), but I thought I'd share my personal experiences with them fitted onto my DT990s.

The graphs they show do bear out in reality for me. The choice leather pads do indeed have quite a bump in the low end compared to stock. Some of that, I think, is down to the fact your ears are slightly further away from the driver (as they're a bit thicker) - perhaps since there's a slightly larger space to resonate? Compressing them against your head ever so slightly equalises this out a bit - and I think gives a flatter sound. The mids and highs also suffer from your ear being placed further from the driver, leading to music sounding a bit muddy. 

But interestingly, after wearing them for about 15 minutes the foam naturally compresses, moving your ear canal into a more optimal spot. Perhaps these ear pads need breaking in to position your ear at exactly the right place for optimum sound. Which may not be a bad thing - perhaps they'll last longer for this reason as they naturally degrade. 

So, perhaps unsurprisingly, they do change the sound signature a lot compared to the stock pads. So, if you're in the business of audio or music production, you'll probably need to EQ this out if you're used to the stock pads (as I am). For casual listening, though, I'm sure this isn't an issue - although caters especially well to bass-freaks over anything else. I never knew [Peter Gabriel - Sledgehammer](https://open.spotify.com/track/029NqmIySn1kOY305AAhxT?si=f6f386a5e6b74e4c) was a 5 minute bass solo.

Aesthetically, I like the look of them. They sit nicely when the cans are not on your head, and the black gives a nice stealth look. They are certainly comfortable too.
