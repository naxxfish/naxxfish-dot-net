**üëãüèª Hi, I'm Chris.**

I'm a software engineer and architect.  

I believe in

  * Ethical, appropriate and sensible application of big data and AI.
  * Robust, yet pragmatic automated testing (100% test coverage is worthless if it doesn't do what it was designed to do!).
  * Designing systems that minimise carbon and energy usage during their operational life. 
  * Being accountable for the products you build.
  * Empowering users to achieve their goals, rather than mollycoddling them and making decisions for them.

My super powers include systems interface design and domain modelling, particularly for esoteric legacy systems.  

I work for [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) in the Cities Engineering team, making cities usable. 

This 'blog' catalogues my various personal analyses and opinions of things that I find interesting, or projects I've undertaken.
