Hi.  I'm Chris.

I'm a software engineer, architect and product manager.  

My super powers include interface design and domain modelling, particularly for esoteric legacy systems.  For example, the [Network Rail Datafeeds](https://github.com/naxxfish/rail-data/) or the [Temporary Speed Restrictions](https://github.com/naxxfish/tsr-explorer) notifications, or the various datafeeds from dispirate systems within in BBC Radio which are brought together through a product called <abbr title ="Named by me after a character in the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy">Fenchurch</abbr> recently featured in the [EBU's tech-i Issue 44](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech-i/tech-i-044.pdf) (see Page 7) which segments, transcribes and tags live radio as it is broadcast.

I believe in

  * Ethical, appropriate and sensible application of big data and AI
  * Robust, yet pragmatic automated testing (100% test coverage is worthless if it doesn't do what it was designed to do!)
  * Designing systems that minimise carbon and energy usage during their operational life. 
  * Avoiding the [Law of instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument) as far as possible
  * Empowering users to achieve their goals, rather than mollycoddling them

This 'blog' catalogues my various analyses and opinions of things that I find interesting, or projects I've undertaken.
