**üëãüèª Hi, I'm Chris.**

I'm a software engineering tech lead and systems architect.

I believe in

* Ethical, appropriate and sensible application of big data and ML.
* Taking a pragmatic approach to automated testing (test coverage isn't everything).
* Designing systems that minimise carbon emissiions and energy usage during their operational life.
* Being accountable for the products you build.
* Empowering users to achieve their goals, rather than mollycoddling them and making decisions for them.
* Harnessing creative chaos where it's useful, but limiting it when it's not.

My super powers include clean systems interface design and domain modelling, particularly for esoteric legacy systems.

I work for [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/), leading the Static Data Engineering team.

This 'blog' catalogues my various personal analyses and opinions of things that I find interesting, or projects I've undertaken.
