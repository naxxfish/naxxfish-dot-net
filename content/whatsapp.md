Hello! You might have found this because I've sent you a message saying that I'm moving phone ðŸ“±

This is in fact true! On the 5th July, 2020, I have got a new phone.

If you have a WhatsApp chat with me going, it will say that my encryption key ðŸ”‘ has been changed. This is a normal thing to happen when setting up a new app on a new phone - doing so has meant that I've had to re-verify my phone number as well. 

Feel free to contact me in whatever way nessecary to convince yourself that I am in fact still me, and that I do - really - have a new phone ðŸ˜‡

If you are being linked to this page with a message sent to you after the 15th July 2020 - then treat it with suspicion and try to contact me via another channel. 

Cheers!
