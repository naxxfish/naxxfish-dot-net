For a long time, I've used Amazon Wishlist to help people figure out what sort of things I'd like to be given as a present. I've decided that isn't a particularly great solution, as it doesn't give people the choice of retailer &ndash; especially where there is a local one they could support instead. 

So I've made my own [Wishlist][1] containing a bunch of things that I'd appreciate, which is hosted by [GitHub pages][2], using some code by [ndarville][3] to render a nice wishlist template using [Jekyll][4]. 

I've included several suppliers for as many of the items as possible, including local retailers.
