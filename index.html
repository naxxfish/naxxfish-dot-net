<span class=post-author>:: naxxfish</span></div><div class=post-content>Hackathons or Hackdays or ‚ÄúInnovation Days‚Äù or whatever you want to call them have been a mainstay in tech for a while now. Sometimes, they‚Äôre seen as a simple ‚Äúfix‚Äù for an organisation that‚Äôs lacking innovation (spoiler: that‚Äôs not how they work). But, just so we‚Äôre all on the same page:
A Hackathon is a time limited sprint where (primarily) software is created
I‚Äôve been purposely vauge here - but I think this definition encompasses most things that someone would call a ‚ÄúHackathon‚Äù.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2022-08-09-crunchless-hackathon/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/posts/2022-07-20-on-fire/>This is fine üî• (no, it&rsquo;s not)</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2022-07-20</span>

<span class=post-author>:: naxxfish</span></div><div class=post-content>Ever since Meta (nee Facebook) announced their intention of building ‚Äúthe Metaverse‚Äù in their Facebook Connect conference keynote in 2021, changing their name in the process - the world has been simultaneously enthrealled, amused and terrified by the idea of spending more of their time in a virtual world rather than the real one.
Maybe it‚Äôs because they remember the dystopian setting of Ready Player One, where people live in towering stacks of containers because their cities have become uninhabitable due to overcrowding and energy shortages are commonplace - and the only way to escape is through the OASIS ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù - leading them to neglect to fix the problems with physical society in preference to enjoying a virtual one instead.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2021-11-29-everyones-building-a-metaverse/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/posts/2021-04-18-crowdfunding-witchhunt/>Crowdfunding Witch-hunt: Debunking Debunks of Aurora Nutrio</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2021-04-18</span>

I also featured a number of exceptionally bizarre campaigns claiming everything from a perpetual motion machine powered by demonic forces (legitimately what the project claimed), to a device that was designed to release your inner <em>chi</em> by regularly beeping (who&rsquo;s campaign text read much like the incoherent ramblings of someone with severe psychosis).</p><p>Over the years, many crowdfunded tech projects have come and gone, and the public has now experienced a range of outcomes from great success (for example the <a href=https://www.riut.co.uk/>RiutBag</a>, which delivered exactly as intended and is a ongoing business delivering new, useful, products regularly), to great failures (like <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down>Juicero</a> - which was a legitimate, but dumb, idea that just failed), to outright scams (like <a href=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1041610927/znaps-the-9-magnetic-adapter-for-your-mobile-devic/description>ZNAPS</a> - where backers have now resorted to magic incantations trying to get their money back).
