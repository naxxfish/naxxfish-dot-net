The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format.\nIt ticks quite a lot of boxes almost immediately. Like many other applications I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at, and certainly the other two mentioned above, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle sync on it\u0026rsquo;s own and relies on another service to handle it for it. However in this case, it directly supports Nextcloud, which is my choice of self-hosted file storage.\nThe notes are in Markdown format - although the files it generates are not. Each device has it\u0026rsquo;s own database, and the synchronised file backend is used as a way to sync those databases. Which does mean, you cannot simply open the files it stores with an editor and expect to edit Markedown as usual - it has to be done through the app.\nAlso, there\u0026rsquo;s mobile apps (hurrah!) so I can access my notes and todos and search them in the same way on both the desktop and mobile.\nMy main gripe is that it\u0026rsquo;s rather tricky to share notes with another person - there\u0026rsquo;s a feature request for that in the forums, though.\nConclusion You may not be surprised that I\u0026rsquo;ve gone for Joplin for my main note taking app. It\u0026rsquo;s using my Nextcloud instance for sync between my Macbook and Pixel 2.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also hoping to help develop the sharing feature which allows two Joplin users to share notes with each other, and ideally edit them collaboratively - that feature would mean I have no reason to use another note-taking app.\n"}</script></head><body class=blue><div class="container center headings--one-size"><header class=header><div class=header__inner><div class=header__logo><a href=/><div class=logo>naxxfish</div></a></div><div class=menu-trigger>menu</div></div><nav class=menu><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--desktop"><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=https://www.github.com/naxxfish/>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://naxxfish.photography>My Photography</a></li><li><a href=/wish-list>Wish List</a></li></ul><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--mobile"><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=https://www.github.com/naxxfish/>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://naxxfish.photography>My Photography</a></li><li><a href=/wish-list>Wish List</a></li></ul></nav></header><div class=content><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/note-taking-apps-for-engineers-2019/>Note-taking apps for Engineers in 2019</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2019-11-17</span>
