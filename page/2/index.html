<span class=post-author>:: naxxfish</span></div><div class=post-content><p>I found myself looking for a better option for tying my hair up in a ponytail. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been doing for over a decade, and isn&rsquo;t likely to change soon. But the ties I&rsquo;ve been buying keep breaking - it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do, they just get looser and looser until they don&rsquo;t hold my hair properly, and then they snap. So I started looking for reusable, robust products designed to fulfil this purpose, and I came across <a href=https://www.tabithaeve.co.uk/products/nobbles-plastic-free-hair-ties>these hair ties from Tabitha Eve</a>. They come in a pack of 5, and their RRP is <strong>¬£10</strong> (although they&rsquo;re on sale for ¬£6 currently). The ones I get normally are about ¬£3 for a pack of 18 from Superdrug.</p><p>This prompted a train of thought - as much as I support sustainable and ethical consumerism - is the hope that one day all consumers will be ethical consumers completely detatched from reality?</p></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/affordable-sustainability-2021/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/whatsapp-android-to-iphone/>Pwnage While-U-Wait: Migrating WhatsApp messages between Android and iOS</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2020-06-04</span>
<span class=post-author>:: naxxfish</span></div><div class=post-content><p>Recently, I made the (somewhat contraversial) decision to move from Android to iOS. And whilst for the most part this process has been polished to a high sheen by Apple, desperate to make the transition frictionless, there are a few notable gaps.</p><p>One of those, is WhatsApp message history - which is not possible to port between OSes. This missing feature has unintentionally spawned a plethora of questionable third party software solutions, and some even more questionable marketing techniques.</p><p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to explore why the problem exists, why it&rsquo;s not easily solved, and the &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; that these software providers are exploiting, and perhaps the people too.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/whatsapp-android-to-iphone/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/2020/03/08/remote-id-and-drones/>Remote ID and Drones</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2020-03-08</span>

Whilst there have yet to be any cases of a drone actually colliding with an aircraft, there&rsquo;s a definitely feeling there is a percieved risk of this occurring - which is sufficient that seeing a drone anywhere near close to an airport will immediately cause mass chaos as the entire airport is grounded until it has been removed.</p><p>With tech giants like Amazon developing automated drone-delivery systems, the number of drones in the skies is likely to increase - and obviously law-makers are being pressured to make sure that this is a safe future.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/2020/03/08/remote-id-and-drones/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/2019/12/08/my-photography-workflow/>My Photography Workflow</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2019-12-08</span>
