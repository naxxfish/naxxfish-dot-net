This is an entirely manual task involving one of us going out with a radio controlled watch and monitoring the passage of trains through stations and junctions. An area of recent interest for us has been attempting to compute this automatically using other known bits of information.</p><p>In order to validate this effort, we either have to do the manual task with a watch or collect a large dataset of GPS traces to compare against our dataset. The more data we have will allow us to improve the end product.</p></blockquote><p>Which is awesome.¬† I wanted to contribute. I found a suitable app for Android called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger">GPSlogger</a>¬†which seemed to fit the bill.¬† It has quite a few settings, so I thought I&rsquo;d write a quick guide on what I&rsquo;ve used to successfully generate a working track for a service.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/2018/03/14/recording-gps-tracks-with-gpslogger-on-android-for-realtime-trains/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/2015/10/30/why-i-dont-want-a-yahoo-id-any-more/>Why I don‚Äôt want a Yahoo ID any more</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2015-10-30</span>

There were some not insignficant challenges. Our normal network access at Keynes was effectively cut off due to some changes to configuration. This was quite troublesome, as we had always previously relied on this access to get our signals back to our HQ. The outlook seemed bleak. What we ended up doing instead, though, actually seemed to work out rather better.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/2014/06/02/keynestock-2014/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/2014/03/19/pathfinderpc-http-json-api/>PathfinderPC HTTP JSON API</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2014-03-19</span>
