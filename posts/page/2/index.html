<p>I found myself looking for a better option for tying my hair up in a ponytail. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been doing for over a decade, and isn&rsquo;t likely to change soon. But the ties I&rsquo;ve been buying keep breaking - it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do, they just get looser and looser until they don&rsquo;t hold my hair properly, and then they snap. So I started looking for reusable, robust products designed to fulfil this purpose, and I came across <a href=https://www.tabithaeve.co.uk/products/nobbles-plastic-free-hair-ties>these hair ties from Tabitha Eve</a>. They come in a pack of 5, and their RRP is <strong>£10</strong> (although they&rsquo;re on sale for £6 currently). The ones I get normally are about £3 for a pack of 18 from Superdrug.</p>
<p>This prompted a train of thought - as much as I support sustainable and ethical consumerism - is the hope that one day all consumers will be ethical consumers completely detatched from reality?</p>

<p>Recently, I made the (somewhat contraversial) decision to move from Android to iOS. And whilst for the most part this process has been polished to a high sheen by Apple, desperate to make the transition frictionless, there are a few notable gaps.</p>
<p>One of those, is WhatsApp message history - which is not possible to port between OSes. This missing feature has unintentionally spawned a plethora of questionable third party software solutions, and some even more questionable marketing techniques.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to explore why the problem exists, why it&rsquo;s not easily solved, and the &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; that these software providers are exploiting, and perhaps the people too.</p>

<p>Drone safety is a topic which has had particular interest after <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47919680>recent incidents</a>. Whilst there have yet to be any cases of a drone actually colliding with an aircraft, there&rsquo;s a definitely feeling there is a percieved risk of this occurring - which is sufficient that seeing a drone anywhere near close to an airport will immediately cause mass chaos as the entire airport is grounded until it has been removed.</p>
<p>With tech giants like Amazon developing automated drone-delivery systems, the number of drones in the skies is likely to increase - and obviously law-makers are being pressured to make sure that this is a safe future.</p>

<p><a href=https://naxxfish.photography>I make photographs</a> in my spare time. Although often they&rsquo;re <a href=https://naxxfish.net/2018/09/01/why-i-shoot-film-in-2018/>on film</a>, but as part of my hybrid workflow they almost always end up going through a digital process at some point.</p>
<p>This post explains how I manage my photos from capture to archive, and how I manage backups.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a <a href=/note-taking-apps-for-engineers-2019>previous post</a>, I&rsquo;ve decided to move to <a href=https://www.joplinapp.org/>Joplin</a> for my note taking needs. One of the last features I was missing was the ability for me to share a note with other people - as I do with Google Keep at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the only one missing this feature, <a href=https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/sharing-notes-or-notebooks/67/38>there&rsquo;s a thread on the forum</a> requesting this that&rsquo;s been open for a long time, and has a <em>lot</em> of views. So I decided to try and help develop it.</p>
