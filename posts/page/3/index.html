They mentioned that they did not personally approve of film photography, as it contains animal products.
This is not something I had previously put much thought into, despite generally agreeing that meat is not a particularly sustainable source of food. Whilst, after a bit of research, I‚Äôm mostly at peace with the fact that photographic emulsion uses an extremely small amount of gelatin ‚Äì primarily as it is making use of a by-product which otherwise would have gone to waste, and in of itself isn‚Äôt a driver for meat production.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/2019/03/10/the-only-way-is-ethics/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://naxxfish.net/2018/10/20/youre-doing-your-shoelaces-wrong/>You‚Äôre lacing your shoelaces wrong</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2018-10-20</span>
