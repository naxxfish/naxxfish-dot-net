<p>As a long time user of <a href=http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/>Realtimetrains.co.uk</a> (which is where you should go for all your real time train tracking needs in the UK), and someone with an appreciation of Open Rail Data (having <a href=https://github.com/naxxfish/nrod-funnel>used it myself</a>), I jumped at the chance of helping their development.¬† They&rsquo;ve put out an appeal to <a href=http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/tracks/>record GPS tracks</a> of train services that you travel on with the link to the service on the application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the work behind the scenes performed by a small team involves maintaining data relating to train positioning and comparing this with the signalling system outputs we use. This is an entirely manual task involving one of us going out with a radio controlled watch and monitoring the passage of trains through stations and junctions. An area of recent interest for us has been attempting to compute this automatically using other known bits of information.</p>
<p>In order to validate this effort, we either have to do the manual task with a watch or collect a large dataset of GPS traces to compare against our dataset. The more data we have will allow us to improve the end product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is awesome.¬† I wanted to contribute. I found a suitable app for Android called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger">GPSlogger</a>¬†which seemed to fit the bill.¬† It has quite a few settings, so I thought I&rsquo;d write a quick guide on what I&rsquo;ve used to successfully generate a working track for a service.</p>

<p>I was at one time, a BT customer. ¬†They had the best deal for FTTC broadband in my area, so it made sense to go with them. ¬†One of the things they offered at the time was a Yahoo account ‚Äì which for some inexplicable reason you were forced to link to any previous account with the same email address.</p>
<p>I created one ‚Äì with my usual online moniker of naxxfish. ¬†What a mistake that turned out to be‚Ä¶.</p>

One of the unique challenges of CSR FMis it‚Äôs structure, where it is part funded by two separate universities each with a presence in Canterbury (University of Kent and Christ Church University) and their respective student unions (Kent Union and CCCU). Student members could be enrolled at either institution, and as such each institution has it‚Äôs own radio studio on campus ‚Äì each of which has an equal chance of being put on air.

Once again, I got roped into helping out CSRfm and this time KTV in getting their OBs from Keynstock 2014 on air.
There were some not insignficant challenges. Our normal network access at Keynes was effectively cut off due to some changes to configuration. This was quite troublesome, as we had always previously relied on this access to get our signals back to our HQ. The outlook seemed bleak. What we ended up doing instead, though, actually seemed to work out rather better.

I‚Äôve been helping with the installation of a brand new Axia Livewire network at CSR FM. We‚Äôve been using PathfinderPC to do all of the routing control.
It‚Äôs all pretty clever stuff ‚Äî but we wanted to be able to extract information from Pathfinder so that we could do handy things like find out which studio is on air, and use that information to show the right webcam on the website, or use it to add further information to our Now Playing data.
